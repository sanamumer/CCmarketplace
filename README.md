# Marketplace Smart Contract

Sample Crosschain marketplace integrating router protocol crosstalk for crosschain functionality.
A cross-chain NFT marketplace is a platform that allows users to buy and sell NFTs across different blockchain networks. This technology removes the limitations of having to use a single blockchain network, and allows users to trade NFTs on the network that offers the best price or features.

The marketplace uses Router Crosstalk to facilitate cross-chain transactions. Router Crosstalk is a cross-chain communication protocol that allows contracts on different blockchain networks to communicate with each other. This allows the marketplace to transfer NFTs between different blockchain networks, making it possible for users to buy and sell NFTs on the network that offers the best price or features.
